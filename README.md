# About the NASA Viewer
NASA Trek is a web app that uses NASA's open APIs: EPIC and TechTransfer endpoints. 

There is a gallery of images from TechTransfer, which "provides structured, searchable developer access to NASAâ€™s patents, software, and technology spinoff descriptions that have been curated to support technology transfer." 

As well as a polychromatic image viewer, provided by EPIC, which "provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument."
